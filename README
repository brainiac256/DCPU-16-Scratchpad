This repo contains random .dasm16 files for the DCPU-16 architecture for Notch's 0x10c.

The random .dasm16 files here will probably be standalone assembler files to demo various functions of in-progress projects (or, in rare cases, finished assembler routines, and in even rarer cases might contain finished assembler routines with relative jumps suitable for hotloading into a running system if I ever arse myself to do something like that). I don't have any particular projects yet but you can expect this README to be updated as that sort of thing comes along.
